Hey there, I'm Stu! 

Trading in my work boots for a comfy chair, I made the career jump from the brewing industry to embark on a new journey into the world of technology.

As an autodidact with a strong desire to learn and an unwavering self-driven attitude, I'm currently teaching myself different front end tools & technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also actively participate in several web developer groups within the vibrant tech community here in Portland, OR.

In my free time, I enjoy creating music, indulging in fine Belgian beer, and honing my skills at the local rock climbing gym.
