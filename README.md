Hey there, I'm Stu! 

I enjoy shredding the strings of my guitar, sipping on fine Belgian beer, and climbing at the local rock gyms. I'm also a motivated and passionate learner who is currently studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pursue a career in web development. Since January 2022 I'v been actively learning and practicing coding skills through The Odin Project. I've also been studying a little bit of web design using WordPress. I'm excited to learn about other front-end technologies such as React, SASS, and Bootstrap to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends!
