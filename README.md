Hey there! I'm a motivated and passionate learner who is currently studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pursue a career in web development. I'v been actively learning and practicing coding skills through The Odin Project. I'm also excited to learn about other front-end technologies such as React, SASS, and Bootstrap to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends!
