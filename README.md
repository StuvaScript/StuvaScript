Hey there, I'm Stu! 

I'm a motivated and passionate learner who is currently studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pursue a career in web development. Since January 2022 I'v been actively learning and practicing coding skills through The Odin Project. Since January 2023 I've also been learning web design using WordPress. I'm also excited to learn about other front-end technologies such as React, SASS, and Bootstrap to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends!
